# Elixirscript Project Boilerplate

This boilerplate is an experimental project structure for an elixirscript frontend project. The structure will probably change over time. When stable this may or may not be included as a feature of the elixirscript cli.

Use gulp and webpack to build and run a dev server.

## Requirements

Must have [elixirscript](https://github.com/bryanjos/elixirscript) installed.

## Comands

Build: `npm run build` - Build result will be in the `dist` folder
Dev Server: `npm run server` - Runs the webpack development server
